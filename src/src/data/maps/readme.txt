To change map you need to provide a mapId (mid or mp) and a position (x,y) for that map
You also need to be a specific location on the current map to be able to change map
and the next map need to be "physically" connected to the current map, otherwise the
server will answer that you cannot change map / it's out of range.

ID = Map name
--------------
1 = pallet town
2 = route 1
3 = hero house f1
4 = hero house f2
6 = professor oak's lab
